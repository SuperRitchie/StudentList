Big O:

Search function has complexity of O(n^2) because it runs a nested if/else statement inside the while loop

Insert function has complexity of O(n) because it runs a single if/else statement

Sort function has complexity of O(n^2) because it runs a do while statement with a nested if/else statement inside it

Delete function has complexity of O(n^7) because it has 7 nested while and if/else statements
